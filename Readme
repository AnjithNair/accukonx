   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Start the Docker containers:

   ```bash

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Install Dependencies

1. With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Run the Application

1. Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
